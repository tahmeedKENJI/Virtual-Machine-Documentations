The following steps are required if you forget your login passwd and need to reset it.

- Start the VM but stay on alert.
- When the VBox menu shows and says to press F12 to enter boot menu, DO IT!!
- From there, enter into normal boot mode by pressing "b".
- Now, you will see a list of kernels. Select the appropriate kernel (usually the first one) and press "e" to enter edit mode.
- find this line:

	linux /boot/vmlinuz-5.x.x-generic root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet splash

  or something like this that starts with "linux" or "linux16"/"linuxfi" etc.
- ----- edit the "ro quiet splash" and replace with "rw init=/bin/bash" -----
- Press Ctrl+X or F10 to boot with these parameters
- Now you are in the root shell.
- enter this command into the terminal:

	passwd username

  where "username" is your actual username
- Remount filesystem and reboot:

	mount -o remount,ro /
   	exec /sbin/init

N.B.: DO NOT STORE PASSWORDS IN PLAINTEXT FORM. DO NOT GIVE AWAY ENCRYPTION METHODS USED TO MASK YOUR PASSWORDS. ALWAYS USE STRONG PASSWORDS!
